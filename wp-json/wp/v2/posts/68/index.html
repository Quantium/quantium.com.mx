Although It is true that these three stages concern about Digital Literacy they don&#8217;t\u00a0completely belong to it.\u00a0 Talking about Digital Competence we can say that this particular stage is more primitive that the other ones and we cannot consider it as a stage that belongs Digital Literacy. Let me explain every single stage to clarify this with the follow diagram:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69\" style=\"width: 597px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-69\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughts.ktcagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Digital-Literacy-1024x611.png\" alt=\"Digital Literacy\" width=\"597\" height=\"356\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-69\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Digital Literacy Processes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Digital Competence is just a requirement<\/h2>\n<p>As we understand, When a user, group or organisation that have reached an acceptable level of Digital Competence is capable to use and take full advantage of\u00a0all the digital tools that they have. Nowadays, Digital Competence is a hard goal to achieve for some organisations and groups, even more for users that don\u2019t belong to digitalised groups\u00a0like older generations or professionals that their work isn&#8217;t related to the use of technology. Furthermore technology evolution is rushing, new tools are coming to the market and the everyday gap between early adopters and common users is shortened, all this together has\u00a0created a huge chasm between users and technology, so we can say that Digital Competence is not a fully completed stage for these ones. <strong>If a company hasn&#8217;t reached full Digital Competence we can\u2019t even talk about reaching Digital Usage<\/strong>. A company like this\u00a0will have (hopefully) some digitalised users that are alienated from the analog ones, maybe these\u00a0users are part of the\u00a0IT department or some Marketing area\u00a0and maybe part of their jobs is to\u00a0advice their coworkers about Digital issues, technology, etc.<\/p>\n<p>When a company that hasn\u2019t reached a fully Digital Competence tries to start with Digital Transformation all the workload\u00a0and <strong>the moral responsibility belongs to the digitalised \u00a0people and anybody\u00a0else<\/strong>, generally the analog ones don\u2019t want to be a part of\u00a0the transformation process, they don\u2019t want to learn anything\u00a0new, they don\u2019t want to change their ways, they only want to follow with their routine, and suddenly one day\u00a0realize that everything that concerns the company technology has improved, works better and is easy to use.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-75 size-full\" title=\"Old Technology\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughts.ktcagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Old-Technology.jpg\" alt=\"Old Techology\" width=\"600\" height=\"356\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-75\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Old Technology is more old than tecnhology<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>As a matter of fact,\u00a0Digital Transformation will fail if the company isn\u2019t prepared for it<\/strong>. First the company need to have reached\u00a0the Digital Usage stage, It\u00a0isn&#8217;t optional, it is mandatory if they really want to start\u00a0a Digital Literacy Process.<\/p>\n<p>But there are other risks for a company that has begin with\u00a0the Digital Usage stage and\u00a0wants\u00a0to start\u00a0a Digital Transformation process skipping the completion of the middle stage.<\/p>\n<h2>The Risks<\/h2>\n<p><strong>The first Risk<\/strong>\u00a0is when\u00a0a company that is on\u00a0the middle step of the Digital Literacy Process generally can&#8217;t realize that\u00a0is in\u00a0the middle of some kind of <strong>comfort zone<\/strong> too. They use technology very good, they knows how to use their tools for work, and \u00a0they can even implement new technologies quickly, so it is very comprehensible that the people of this kind of company will hesitate\u00a0about taking a new step, a huge step to fully achieve the myth of Digital Transformation. But lets be clear about some points here: <strong>Being\u00a0a Digital Usage company doesn\u2019t mean that the clients of the company can communicate with it in a fully digital way<\/strong>, doesn\u2019t mean that the company is <strong>Innovating<\/strong>, doesn\u2019t mean that the company is <strong>creative<\/strong>, the only thing that this means is that the company work <strong>faster<\/strong>, but, if you have a bunch of analog shitty processes that returns bureaucracy and creates unsatisfied customers, it will multiply the bureaucracy and dissatisfaction when the digital tools boost the work and empower the processes.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_70\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70\" style=\"width: 542px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/thoughts.ktcagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/apes-width-iPad.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-70\" src=\"http:\/\/thoughts.ktcagency.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/apes-width-iPad-300x234.jpg\" alt=\"Apes width an iPad\" width=\"542\" height=\"423\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-70\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Give them an iPad doesn&#8217;t mean that you are digitalizing them<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong> The second risk<\/strong> \u00a0is the use of heap\u00a0technology tools, expensive software that fits the international mainstream standards and \u00a0fancy touchscreen devices; using it\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean that your processes are digitalised. <strong>And that\u00a0is the main issue about jumping between the Digital Usage Stage to the\u00a0Digital Transformation one<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>What you need to do?<\/h2>\n<p>So, we need to start an honest process to achieve a fully Digital Transformation without spend lots of money trying and failing.
